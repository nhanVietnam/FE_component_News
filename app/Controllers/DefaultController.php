Remote learning would begin Wednesday with in-person classes slated to return Jan. 18, if case numbers hold right.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Scores of Chicago Public Schools staff and students are already absent from in-person classes because they have COVID-19 or are quarantining because of possible exposure. But Lightfoot, CPS and public health officials have repeatedly opposed a wholesale return to remote learning during the standoff that so far has resulted in three days of canceled classes.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">\u201cCTU leadership, you\u2019re not listening. The best, safest place for kids to be is in school.

That\u2019s what the science supports. We will not relent.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">But at a news conference Saturday at which civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson also appeared, CTU President Jesse Sharkey argued that the new offer \u201cwould solve all the outstanding issues, would give parents the clarity that we will begin instruction next week and begin in-person instruction on the 18th.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a long, indefinite period where schools are remote,\u201d Sharkey said, but a temporary measure while \u201cwe\u2019re dealing with the high point of a surge.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">He contended that \u201cwhat the mayor is basically offering instead is no instruction at all. \u2026 This impasse is hurting students.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">As of Thursday, the union had demanded a negative PCR test for students to return to class, but the new proposal would scrap that requirement for a plan in which 10% of a school\u2019s population would be tested at random each week, plus those who already opted for the voluntary weekly testing program.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"width:726.797px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/resizer\/Rhdnilxgv8n3w-G1IRkMVJGb-NU=\/800x512\/top\/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com\/tronc\/5VDZURQIXBGXFJIFOXUA72ZYOM.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey, from left, the Rev.

(Chris Sweda \/ Chicago Tribune)<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The metrics to switch a school to remote learning would be 20% or more of a school\u2019s CTU staff isolating or quarantining because of COVID-19, or 25% if there are fewer than 100 employees at the school.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Schools would also be shut down for in-person learning for elementary schools if 30% of homerooms have more than 30% students isolating, and high schools and middle school programs if more than 25% of the student body are isolating.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Another new proposal is demanding a greater substitute teacher stipend of $1,000 compared to the normal $420 monthly stipend.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The union also continues to call for regular mask distribution and for reinstating the health screener at schools that want that option.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">\u201cDespite the fact that school districts across the state and nation are taking an opt-out approach to COVID-19 testing, Mayor Lightfoot has called the COVID-19 nasal swab test an \u2018invasive medical procedure,\u2019\u201d the union said, adding that under its proposal, students could still opt out of screening.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Jennifer Johnson, the CTU\u2019s chief of staff, said union members want students back in school but they also want additional safety measures. CTU would also like all staff to provide a negative COVID-19 test in the coming week, she said, adding union members are willing to participate in contact tracing on a school building level.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">\u201cWe\u2019re really looking for collaboration here,\u201d she said.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Saturday evening, CPS issued a point-by-point response to the union\u2019s offer, agreeing to several of CTU\u2019s requests on masking, screeners and testing but rejecting others, including the central feature of the proposal, a pause in in-person classes until Jan. 18.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Again calling the union\u2019s actions an \u201cillegal strike,\u201d CPS said the sides are \u201cgrowing closer on many important issues. We\u2019re confident that continued negotiations will support the return to in-person learning next week.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">If negotiators at CPS are willing to reach an agreement, the CTU\u2019s governing<strong> <\/strong>body then has to approve<strong> <\/strong>it before the rank-and-file members vote.

The governor\u2019s office also said the state later got a request to send its teams to CPS in the last week of October and proposed a plan within days.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Following a Nov. 4 request from the Chicago Department of Public Health, the state and CPS reached an agreement to provide a vaccination clinic on the West Side eight days later, when the district canceled school to encourage young people to get the shot.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">But according to the governor\u2019s office, CPS then \u201craised objections to future clinics,\u201d requiring an extra background check, as well as a tuberculosis test for staff administering the clinics, the latter being something no other school districts in the state requested.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">CPS said in an earlier statement that the district receives federal funding for school testing and that the state\u2019s testing resources are for school districts outside Chicago.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">\u201cWe would welcome any additional testing resources,\u201d the city added.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The city did not have an immediate response to the governor\u2019s office\u2019s latest statement about vaccine clinics.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The latest developments on the CPS impasse comes as the district reports 1,025 new student COVID-19 cases and 939 new staff cases from Monday to Thursday, a record for both groups.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Despite the numbers, Chicago\u2019s public health commissioner, Dr. Allison Arwady, has insisted that schools with proper mitigation are the safest place for children.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Jackson said at the union news conference Saturday he appreciates Lightfoot\u2019s point that students are better off in schools but, \u201con the other hand, teachers want safe working conditions.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Jackson also said he wanted to see the CTU and school officials continue to sit down in person and come up with a plan.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">\u201cI\u2019m surprised they\u2019re not meeting right now. ... We don\u2019t have time to wait,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job is to try to get them back at the table ... not communicate on Zoom.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Sharkey said this proposal provides a comprehensive solution that has an exact date to return to in-person instruction.<\/p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">He added that whether in-person learning being better than remote is beside the point, comparing the situation to when a blizzard shuts down school because it\u2019s too dangerous for students and staff to get there. While in the past school had to be canceled altogether, now remote learning is an option.<\/p>","activated":1,"index":0,"created_at":"2022-01-09T05:07:23.000000Z","updated_at":"2022-01-09T05:07:23.000000Z"}]}';
